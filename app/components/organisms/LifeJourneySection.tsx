                </h1>

                <p>
                    I’m a normal village child from a humble, hardworking family. My
                    father took many risks and worked tirelessly to support my studies
                    and give me a better future...
                </p>

                <p>
                    At age 11, I shifted to a government school, and everything changed.
                    I didn’t feel confident or connected. I was seen as just an{" "}

                    </span>
                    , and the only support I found was from teachers who saw some
                    potential in me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By age 15, I started asking myself deep questions: <br />
                    <span className="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">
                        “Why am I here?”

                    <br />
                    <span className="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">
                        “What am I supposed to become?”
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The only thing that held me together was the pure love of my parents.
                    They gave me{" "}

                    ✨ Turning Point
                </h2>

                <p>
                    I entered college filled with confusion. No tech background, no
                    clarity. But I decided to learn steadily. Slowly, I explored Web
                    Development and Data Analytics, doing small projects and online
                    courses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The real turning point came when someone believed in me — more than
                    I believed in myself.
